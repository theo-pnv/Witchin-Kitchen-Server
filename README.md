# con2-server

## Build & Run

Clone the project in a separated folder from the main application and the audience application.

Open the project with your favorite JS IDE (e.g. VS Code, Atom, Webstorm...) if you need to make amendments to the project. It's written in typescript.

Two commands to run the server (Have npm installed, it runs with node JS):

````
npm install
npm start
````

The server should now run on `localhost:8080`.
